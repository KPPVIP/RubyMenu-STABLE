# Ruby Menu

[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/Rubylium/RubyMenu.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/Rubylium/RubyMenu)

Ruby Menu was made few month ago while i was into cheating, it got used as source code for many other popular menu like Lynx, tiago menu and others that i don't even know.
Now that i see lot of people using my code to sell things, i'm making this source code public so everyone can use it for free. I will probably add things to it soon, remember it's only a LUA menu, it's not an cheating menu until you found a way to use it as an cheating menu.
This code is old and not optimised at **all**, you will have FPS drop while using it for sure.
